# Description
Thanks team Insynk Studios,
I like the your website, and i am well aligned with the company ideology
 - I also like to be detail-oriented for whatever i build.

Here is my thought process while Completing this challenge
## What are the steps you took to approach this assignment & How much time did you spend on each step?
A) Went through the whole requirements, understood the product, took the decision that i'll make it little bit
  challenging for myself as well, i will create backend along with frontend ( I know its not required but, but i love whatever i try to build...) ( Time taken - 30 mins.)
